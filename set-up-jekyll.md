# Set up Jekyll

## Issues and how i fixed

### after installation, `Jekyll not found`
I don't care why this is, something to do with Ruby, f knows what any of this stuff means.

Anyway, the way I fixed:
```bash
sudo gem install -n /usr/local/bin jekyll
```
and worked. This from [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8146249/jekyll-command-not-found)
